# remove_silkscreen_plugin
KiCad plugin that removes silkscreen objects from each footprint for a cleaner looking board!

Removes silkscreen from all footprints, on the front and back of the board. Does NOT remove silkscreen component designators (e.g. R49, D3, etc.) For this please use [this plugin](https://github.com/ulikoehler/KiCADBulkHideSilkscreenDesignators) by Uli Kohler.

Reloading footprints from library will bring back the silkscreen.
